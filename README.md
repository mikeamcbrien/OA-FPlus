# OA-FPlus
OhioAnts Founding PLUS chamber based on readily available 50mmx75mm microscope slides is an opensource project designed for keeping and founding new ant colonies. This is an upgrade in size from the OA-F25 with more focus on open airflow for the nest, with more room for quick growing colonies. The OA-FPLUS is designed with input from dozens of ant-keepers as the ultimate founding chamber for newly collected queens. 

## Details
The OA-FPlus has the following features.

1. Dual entry/exit slide glass top allows quick changing of dirty or soiled glass with minimal disruption to the colony.
2. Separate founding chamber, easily expandable once the colony grows. 
3. When used with a heat cable, the nest has four distinct temperature zones.
    1. Warm/Humid
    2. Warm/Dry
    3. Cool/Humid
    4. Cool/Dry
4. Stainless steel mesh barrier. For airflow and humidity control.
5. Expandable connection port
6. Water fill port, fit 18 GA needle for non-disruptive watering 
7. Water overflow port prevents your colony from drowning if overfilled or filled too quickly.

## Printing
Print at .2mm height and 25-30% infill. The 50mm x 75mm glass microscope slides may not fit if printed at a thicker layer.

Both PLA and PETG are great for this formicarium. PLA tends to print better, and all of the OA OpenSource is tested with PLA.
